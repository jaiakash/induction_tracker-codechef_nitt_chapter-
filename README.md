## Performance Tracker

This code tracks the performance of users in cp contests. Right now supported platforms are codechef, codeforces and atcoder. Add the usernames to list and then run the script. It will open browser with user performance.

## Usage
#### Add usernames to list
```
...
username_atcoder = ["akashjaiswal03", "user2"]
username_codechef = ["akashjaiswal03", "user2"]
username_codeforces = ["johnAKJ", "user2"]
...
```
#### Set value to true for platform
```
...
Codeforces = False
Codechef = False
Atcoder = True
...
```
#### Run the script
```
python track_performance.py
```

I made this project for tracking performance of participants during the induction of NITT Codechef chapter.
